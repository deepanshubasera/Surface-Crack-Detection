Surface Crack Detection using CNN
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify surface images as cracked or non-cracked. The model is trained on a dataset from Kaggle, enabling automated defect detection for infrastructure and industrial applications.

ðŸ“Œ Dataset
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arunrk7/surface-crack-detection

ðŸ”¹ Key Features
âœ… Preprocessed and augmented images for better generalization
âœ… CNN model trained using TensorFlow/Keras
âœ… Achieves high accuracy in detecting surface cracks
âœ… Suitable for real-world defect detection in construction and manufacturing

ðŸš€ How It Works
Load and preprocess the dataset (resize, normalize).
Train a CNN model on labeled crack and non-crack images.
Evaluate model performance using test data.
Use the trained model to classify new images.
