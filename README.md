# Surface Crack Detection using CNN
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify surface images as cracked or non-cracked. The model is trained on a dataset from Kaggle, enabling automated defect detection for infrastructure and industrial applications.

#  Dataset
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arunrk7/surface-crack-detection

# Key Features
1. Preprocessed and augmented images for better generalization
2. CNN model trained using TensorFlow/Keras
3. Achieves high accuracy in detecting surface cracks
4. Suitable for real-world defect detection in construction and manufacturing

# How It Works
1. Load and preprocess the dataset (resize, normalize).
2. Train a CNN model on labeled crack and non-crack images.
3. Evaluate model performance using test data.
4. Use the trained model to classify new images.
